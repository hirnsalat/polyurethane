The chapter starts with an introduction to ethnography and its challenges when going digital. It then provides an overview of the different approaches to digital ethnography depending on the object of study: (1) the ethnography of online communities, virtual worlds, and social media sites; (2) the connective ethnography proposal through online and offline field settings; and (3) the ethnography of everyday life and the issue of audiences and creative practices in digital media. Finally, we discuss methodological issues relating to how to conduct online ethnographic fieldwork, including participant observation, interviews, as well as digital tools for registering, analyzing, presenting data, and some ethical considerations.","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781444361506.wbiems193/abstract","ISBN":"978-1-4443-6150-6","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Ardévol","given":"Elisenda"},{"family":"Gómez-Cruz","given":"Edgar"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,23]]},"DOI":"10.1002/9781444361506.wbiems193"},

Author Mike Rohde shows you how to incorporate sketchnoting techniques into your note-taking process--regardless of your artistic abilities--to help you better process the information that you are hearing and seeing through drawing, and to actually have fun taking notes.  The Sketchnote Handbook explains and illustrates practical sketchnote techniques for taking visual notes at your own pace as well as in real time during meetings and events. Rohde also addresses most people's fear of drawing by showing, step-by-step, how to quickly draw people, faces, type, and simple objects for effective and fast sketchnoting. The book looks like a peek into the author's private sketchnote journal, but it functions like a beginner's guide to sketchnoting with easy-to-follow instructions for drawing out your notes that will leave you itching to attend a meeting just so you can draw about it.","ISBN":"978-0-321-85789-7","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Rohde","given":"Mike"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"title-short":"The Sketchnote Handbook"},

We discuss these pitfalls, identify how existing studies succeed or fail in overcoming them, and provide guidelines for more definitive tests of the effects of gaming on cognition.","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00226/full","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00226","ISSN":"1664-1078","language":"English","author":[{"family":"Boot","given":"Walter Richard"},{"family":"Blakely","given":"Daniel P."},{"family":"Simons","given":"Daniel J."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,2,4]]},"container-title-short":"Front.

A Meta-Analysis of Video Game Influences on Children’s and Adolescents’ Aggression, Mental Health, Prosocial Behavior, and Academic Performance","container-title":"Perspectives on Psychological Science","page":"646-666","volume":"10","issue":"5","source":"SAGE Journals","abstract":"The issue of whether video games—violent or nonviolent—“harm” children and adolescents continues to be hotly contested in the scientific community, among politicians, and in the general public. To date, researchers have focused on college student samples in most studies on video games, often with poorly standardized outcome measures. To answer questions about harm to minors, these studies are arguably not very illuminating. In the current analysis, I sought to address this gap by focusing on studies of video game influences on child and adolescent samples. The effects of overall video game use and exposure to violent video games specifically were considered, although this was not an analysis of pathological game use. Overall, results from 101 studies suggest that video game influences on increased aggression (r = .06), reduced prosocial behavior (r = .04), reduced academic performance (r = −.01), depressive symptoms (r = .04), and attention deficit symptoms (r = .03) are minimal. Issues related to researchers’ degrees of freedom and citation bias also continue to be common problems for the field. Publication bias remains a problem for studies of aggression. Recommendations are given on how research may be improved and how the psychological community should address video games from a public health perspective.","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691615592234","DOI":"10.1177/1745691615592234","ISSN":"1745-6916","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Ferguson","given":"Christopher J."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,9,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,2,4]]},"title-short":"Do Angry Birds Make for Angry Children?","container-title-short":"Perspect Psychol Sci"},

This study investigated whether and to which degree experience with such videogames generalizes to other cognitive control tasks. Experienced video game players (VGPs) and individuals with little to no videogame experience (NVGPs) performed on a N-back task and a stop-signal paradigm that provide a relatively well-established diagnostic measure of the monitoring and updating of working memory (WM) and response inhibition (an index of behavioral impulsivity), respectively. VGPs were faster and more accurate in the monitoring and updating of WM than NVGPs, which were faster in reacting to go signals, but showed comparable stopping performance. Our findings support the idea that playing FPS games is associated with enhanced flexible updating of task-relevant information without affecting impulsivity.","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00426-012-0415-2","DOI":"10.1007/s00426-012-0415-2","ISSN":"0340-0727, 1430-2772","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Colzato","given":"Lorenza S."},{"family":"Wildenberg","given":"Wery P.

However, benefits of playing other video games are under-investigated. We examined whether playing non-action games also improves cognition. Hence, we compared transfer effects of an action and other non-action types that required different cognitive demands.   Methodology/Principal Findings We instructed 5 groups of non-gamer participants to play one game each on a mobile device (iPhone/iPod Touch) for one hour a day/five days a week over four weeks (20 hours). Games included action, spatial memory, match-3, hidden- object, and an agent-based life simulation. Participants performed four behavioral tasks before and after video game training to assess for transfer effects. Tasks included an attentional blink task, a spatial memory and visual search dual task, a visual filter memory task to assess for multiple object tracking and cognitive control, as well as a complex verbal span task. Action game playing eliminated attentional blink and improved cognitive control and multiple-object tracking. Match-3, spatial memory and hidden object games improved visual search performance while the latter two also improved spatial working memory. Complex verbal span improved after match-3 and action game training.   Conclusion/Significance Cognitive improvements were not limited to action game training alone and different games enhanced different aspects of cognition. We conclude that training specific cognitive abilities frequently in a video game improves performance in tasks that share common underlying demands. Overall, these results suggest that many video game-related cognitive improvements may not be due to training of general broad cognitive systems such as executive attentional control, but instead due to frequent utilization of specific cognitive processes during game play. Thus, many video game training related improvements to cognition may be attributed to near-transfer effects.","URL":"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0058546","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0058546","ISSN":"1932-6203","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Oei","given":"Adam C."},{"family":"Patterson","given":"Michael D."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,3,13]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,2,4]]},"title-short":"Enhancing Cognition with Video Games","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE"},

Empirical research regarding this relationship, however, is limited. The goal of the presented study was to examine whether strategic video game play (i.e., role playing and strategy games) predicted self-reported problem solving skills among a sample of 1,492 adolescents (50.8 % female), over the four high school years. The results showed that more strategic video game play predicted higher self-reported problem solving skills over time than less strategic video game play. In addition, the results showed support for an indirect association between strategic video game play and academic grades, in that strategic video game play predicted higher self-reported problem solving skills, and, in turn, higher self-reported problem solving skills predicted higher academic grades. The novel findings that strategic video games promote self-reported problem solving skills and indirectly predict academic grades are important considering that millions of adolescents play video games every day.","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10964-013-9913-9","DOI":"10.1007/s10964-013-9913-9","ISSN":"0047-2891, 1573-6601","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Adachi","given":"Paul J.

We conducted two meta-analyses based on different research designs to investigate how video games impact information-processing skills (auditory processing, executive functions, motor skills, spatial imagery, and visual processing). Quasi-experimental studies (72 studies, 318 comparisons) compare habitual gamers with controls; true experiments (46 studies, 251 comparisons) use commercial video games in training. Using random-effects models, video games led to improved information processing in both the quasi-experimental studies, d = 0.61, 95 % CI [0.50, 0.73], and the true experiments, d = 0.48, 95 % CI [0.35, 0.60]. Whereas the quasi-experimental studies yielded small to large effect sizes across domains, the true experiments yielded negligible effects for executive functions, which contrasted with the small to medium effect sizes in other domains. The quasi-experimental studies appeared more susceptible to bias than were the true experiments, with larger effects being reported in higher-tier than in lower-tier journals, and larger effects reported by the most active research groups in comparison with other labs.

Combining conclusions from media effects research informed by the communication effects literature with those from ethnographic research informed by a sociocultural perspective on cognition and learning, we present a shared theoretical framework for understanding (a) the extent to which such virtual worlds are structurally similar to “third places” (Oldenburg, 1999) for informal sociability, and (b) their potential function in terms of social capital (Coleman, 1988; Putnam, 2000). Our conclusion is that by providing spaces for social interaction and relationships beyond the workplace and home, MMOs have the capacity to function as one form of a new “third place” for informal sociability. Participation in such virtual “third places” appears particularly well suited to the formation of bridging social capital—social relationships that, while not usually providing deep emotional support, typically function to expose the individual to a diversity of worldviews.","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/11/4/885/4617703","DOI":"10.1111/j.1083-6101.2006.00300.x","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Steinkuehler","given":"Constance A."},{"family":"Williams","given":"Dmitri"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,7,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,2,4]]},"title-short":"Where Everybody Knows Your (Screen) Name","container-title-short":"J Comput Mediat Commun"}
